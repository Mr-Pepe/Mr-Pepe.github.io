    I am an experienced research assistant and data visualization specialist 
    with a strong record in research, statistical, and computer programming, 
    especially in R and Python. My strengths include quantitative analysis, written 
    communication, and public speaking. I thrive in both leadership and team roles, 
    and I am thrilled to pursue data science-related opportunities for the spring of 2021.
