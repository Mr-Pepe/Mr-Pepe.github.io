    I always thought my dream was to be an academic. I’d be a quick-on-her-feet economist at some no-frills nonprofit saving the world, or perhaps create cornerstone papers on growth theory from a professorial study. I imagined composing beautiful, tight-knit theories that described the world - or should be describing the world, anyway.

    Then I opened R and caught fire. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The spark in me for coding ignited the second a teacher taught me how to use my knowledge of matrix algebra to populate a vector and run a loop on it. It was stoked everytime I picked up a new language (C++, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MATLAB) and molded the code to do my bidding for projects in physics, UX/UI design, machine-learning, or geospatial data visualization, to name a few. Everytime I jumped from my seat, ecstatic that my hypothesis was correct or my thesis had found statistically significant results, I added more coals to this fire.

    I am now a masters candidate at the <b><a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia School of Data 
        Science</a></b>, compounding on an economic policy / mathematics / statistics focus as an undergraduate. I am just as enthusiastic about improving the world, but now I look to garner the skills that will help me explain it through the data and creative analysis which compliments theory. My specialties include quickly learning new programming languages, creative problem-solving, and passion to make things function better and more effectively for organizations.
