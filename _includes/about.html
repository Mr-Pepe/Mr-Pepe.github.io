    Hi! My name's Amanda West and I'm a current masters student at the
    <b><a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia School of Data 
    Science</a></b>.
    
    As an undergraduate, my focus was in <b>economics, policy,</b> and <b>mathematics</b>. 
    I am especially interested in seeing how public entities can improve decision-making 
    processes through data science, particularly relating to eliminating gender discrimination
    and poverty alleviation. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I love to hike, read historical fiction novels, 
    experiment with my espresso maker, and travel (and record it all in 
    my <b><a href="https://postcardsfromthefadedblue.wordpress.com/">ongoing travel blog</a></b>).
    
    I love self expression of all forms, especially when I've created a 
    beautiful new data visualization or got a chunk of code working flawlessly.
    
    <br> 
    <br>
 
    If you think I would be a good fit for your company, want to grab a coffee, 
    or just want to drop tips on future travel destinations, you can reach me
    at <b>amawest@umich.edu</b> or find out more about me on <b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-west-a33260131/">LinkedIn</a></b>.
    
    Looking forward to our chat!
