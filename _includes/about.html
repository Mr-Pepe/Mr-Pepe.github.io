    <emsp>I am an experienced research assistant and data visualization specialist 
    with a strong record in research, statistical, and computer programming, 
    especially in R and Python. My strengths include quantitative analysis, written 
    communication, and public speaking. I thrive in both leadership and team roles, 
    and I am thrilled to pursue data science-related opportunities for the spring of 2021.
    <br>
    <emsp>As an undergraduate, I also had the fantastic opportunity to be a student athlete
    while dually pursuing my degree and writing an honors thesis. I've practiced and 
    competed in taekwondo in Albania, China, South Korea, and the United States. 
    This experience also gave me leadership and public speaking experience as a regular
    instructor at the University of Michigan. My life as a student athlete has 
    bettered my time management, oral communication, and work ethic, and I am excited 
    to bring these skills to data science opportunities in the near term.
