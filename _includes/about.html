    Hi! My name's Amanda West and I'm a current masters student at the
    <a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia School of Data 
    Science</a>. As an undergraduate, my focus was in economics, math, and policy, 
    and I am most interested in seeing how public entities can improve decision making 
    processes through data science. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I am an experienced research assistant and data visualization specialist 
    with a strong record in research, statistical, and computer programming, 
    especially in R and Python. My strengths include quantitative analysis, data visualization, 
    and written and oral communication. I thrive in both leadership and team roles, 
    and I am currently pursuing data-driven opportunities beginning June of 2021.
    <br>
    <br>
    I love to hike, read historical fiction novels with a warm beverage, 
    experiment with my espresso maker, or travel (and record it all in 
    my <a href="https://postcardsfromthefadedblue.wordpress.com/">ongoing travel blog</a>).
    If you think I would be a good fit for your company, want to grab a coffee (as a mentor or
    mentee), or just want to give me some tips on future travel destinations, you can reach me
    at amawest@umich.edu. Looking forward to our chat!
    </p>
